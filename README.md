# invoice-splitter

Bill splitter app allows you to create a new bill and split the bill among a group of friends or family. You don't have to waste your time counting one bill several times because with this application you only need to enter the total amount of the bill, the number of people and a tip and thanks to this the application will calculate by itself how much each is owed. It also has many other features such as creating mathematical operations on even the most cosmic numbers. Many times as a student I have encountered a situation when a wonderful evening ends with a dispute about the settlement for food. Don't derange your mood, get a bill splitter.


Why only one commit?

Because itsâ€™s just a final state of the commits I did privately during learning and now I am cleaning up this code and applying my latest knowledge so you can see the final version of the project soon :)
